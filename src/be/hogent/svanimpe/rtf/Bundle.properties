OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin allows you to copy text to the clipboard with its formatting intact. \
    The formatting is saved as rich text (RTF). \
    The following formatting is preserved:\n\n* Font family. \
    This requires the receiving application to have the same font installed.\n* Font size.\n* Syntax coloring and highlights.\n* Bold, italic, underline and strikethrough highlights.\n\n\
    Unicode characters are supported as well.\n\n\
    Usage:\n\n- Open a file in the editor and select some text.\n- Go to the 'Edit' menu and select 'Copy Formatted'.\n- The selected text will be converted to RTF and pasted to the clipboard.\n- The result is shown in an output window for reference. \
    Any errors that might occur will be shown here as well.\n\n\
    Tested on NetBeans 7.1.2 (OS X Lion) with Pages 4.1 & TextEdit.\n\
    Tested on NetBeans 7.1.1 (Windows 7) with Word 2010 & WordPad.\n\n\
    Known issues:\n\n- The font face (bold, italic) is not saved. \
    Only separate bold and italic highlights seem to work.\n- Mac users need to run NetBeans with Apple's JDK. \
    Clipboard support in OpenJDK is limited.\n- Because of an implementation dependency, this plugin might need to be recompiled for your version of NetBeans.\n\n\
